## PR2 Robot 3D Perception
This project gives the PR2 robot the ability to locate an object in a cluttered environment, pick it up and then move it to some other location. This is an interesting problem to solve and is a challenge at the forefront of the robotics industry today.
The project uses a perception pipeline to identify target objects from a so-called “Pick-List” in that particular order, pick up those objects and place them in corresponding drop-boxes.
